        <p>In the future, I am not totally sure on who and what I will like to be. I have a couple ideas; a medicial doctor or
        a programmer. Currently, I have been studying really hard to get in some sort of high univeristy. Since the 4th grade, I have
        built robots, study computer science and tried my best to go up and beyond. Coding is a really fun hobby and I will love to 
        have it as a hobby. </p>
        <p>The characterist that I am most grateful of possessing is my work ethic. 
        Everyday, I love to challange myself with harder challanges that will make me better in the future. For example, 
        I will always challange myself to swim faster, code better, getting a 4.0+, etc. Robotics is highly mentally based and with this 
        hobby/"sport", I feel like it makes me a better person. I know that I am only a freshmen but I am taking 2 AP tests this year and I couldn't be happier.
        I would not give robotics and my classes up for the world.</p>
        <p>Besides being a hard worker, I am always coperative and friendly. Most of the time, I am not always a leader but 
        I am always ready to help and make new friends. Constantly, I am helping others with their work, cheering them up and making sure 
        they will do good. I don't judge others from what people have told me or how they are treated. I like to know everybodys story. 
        These quailities make me a strong person and I cannot wait for the rest of my high school year and beyond. </p>
