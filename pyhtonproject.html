   <h2>Written Response - </h2>
<p>I experienced multiple difficulties when developing my Python Project. These difficulties helped me
understand the concepts of Python and made me into a better programmer. A minor issue I met was restarting my
programming. Past programming was deleted by my cats running over my keyboard and it was hard to 
recreate the past code. It was difficult to see what was wrong and right. A major issue I had while coding 
was the “state machine” and “global state” was a major difference. My JavaScript program had buttons and photos
 while this one just used text, making this a confusing switch for me.</p>
