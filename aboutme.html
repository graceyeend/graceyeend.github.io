       <h3>Career Goal</h3>
        <p>In the future, I am not totally sure on who and what I will like to be. I have a couple ideas: a medical doctor or
        a programmer. Currently, I have studied really hard to get in some sort of high university. Since the 4th grade, I have
        built robots, study computer science and tried my best to go up and beyond. Coding is a really fun hobby and I will love to 
        have it as a job. </p>

        <h3> Personal Qualities </h3>
        <p>The characterists that I am most grateful of possessing is my work ethic. 
        Everyday, I love to challenge myself with harder challenges that will make me better in the future. For example, 
        I will always challenge myself to swim faster, code better, getting a 4.0+, etc. Robotics is highly mentally based and with this 
        hobby/"sport", I feel like it makes me a better person. I know that I am only a freshmen, but I am taking 2 AP tests this year and I couldn't be happier.
        I would not give robotics and my classes up for the world. Besides being a hard worker, I am always cooperative and friendly. Most of the time, I am not always a leader but 
        I am always ready to help and make new friends. Constantly, I am helping others with their work, cheering them up and making sure 
        they will do good. I don't judge others from what people have told me or how they are treated. I like to know everybody's story. </p>

        <h3> What I Learned Through These Experiences </h3>
        <p> These qualities make me a strong person and I cannot wait for the rest of my high school year and beyond. I have been 
        very fortunate to express these qualities. I have been blessed with the characterists that I have been delt 
        throughout my life, and I am counting on using them to my best advantage. </p>
